          <p>My name is Dean Hernandez. I am a Theater Major at URI with concentrations in Acting Performence 
               as well as Costume and Lighting Design. Theater is a huge part of my life. Since starting college,
               i have worked in many theaters, both community and professionalm, in many aspects including acting,
               stagecraft, lights, and costumes.<br>
               <br>
               Costumes is my primary focus in design. I have designed for shows as small as 2 actors, 
               with one production having 25 actors who required at least 2 costumes each. I love acting and will continue to do it as
               much as I can. For a career at my age, design is a more realistic way to push myself into the industry.
               Some of my favorite shows I have worked on include <em>The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Young Fankentsein, 
               Little Shop of Horrors,</em> and <em>Mary Poppins</em>.
