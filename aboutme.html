          <h2>About Me</h2>
          
          <p>My name is Dean Hernandez. I am a Theater Major at URI with concentrations in Acting Performence 
               as well as Costume and Lighting Design. Theater is a huge part of my life. Since starting college,
               i have worked in many theaters, both community and professionalm, in many aspects including acting,
               stagecraft, lights, and costumes.
               <br>
               Costumes is my primary focus in design. i have designed for shows as small as 2 actors, 
               to one production with 25 actors with 2 costumes each. I love acting and will continue to do it as
               much as i can. for a career at my age, design is a more realistic way to push myself into the industry.
               Some of my favorite shows i have worked on include <em>The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Young Fankentsein, 
               Little Shop of Horrors,</em> and <em>Mary Poppins</em>.
